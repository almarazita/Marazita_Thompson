% How do modulations to the different cue locations compare?

% How does discriminability relate to modulations?
    % Better version of discriminability?
    % Category classification?
    % Comparison of PCA spaces?

% First step is likely to create a psuedo-population code.
    % Binned spike matrix concatination?
        % Depends on timing variations?
            % I think dPCA might still work however?
            % Hazard, cue location, choice, is_switch (definition?)
